# Octagon-ZK-Oracle
Operation Octagon: An 8-node industrial DePIN network using zkVerify to cryptographically validate carbon-negative energy production for the global carbon market. We are not building a new L1. We are building a ZK-Circuit that serves as a bridge between physical Plasma Gasification sensors and the zkVerify settlement layer.

We are building the first Industrial Zero-Knowledge Carbon Oracle. Employing zkVerify to cryptographically prove that the Agra Energy Plasma Unit is generating net-negative carbon power, without revealing the proprietary biomass recipe (Trade Secrets).
